## 🛠 Build & Development

To set up **webpack** and start your development environment, follow these steps:

1. First, build your project to create the `dist` folder:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Then, start the development server with webpack:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Finally, you can run both the development server and Express simultaneously for hot reloading and a working backend:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
